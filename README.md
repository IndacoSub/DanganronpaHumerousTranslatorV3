# DanganronpaHumerousTranslator
A tool to google translate Danganronpa into random languages 10 times and back

A modified version of [Danganronpa Tools]() to google translate all the text in the game

this can also be modified to do all sorts of large scale text processing,

This program has incredible speed due to the extensive use of parallel processing. 

(So fast that the google translate end point cops it every now and again and says there are too many requests, oops.)

You can edit the amount of threads or just switch to another network and rerun the program to continue
